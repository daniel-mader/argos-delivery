## Argos Delivery

![argos_logo](assets/repo_banner.png)

**Argos Delivery** is a project created in the scope of the [IOT2TANGLE Hackathon](https://hackathon.iot2tangle.io/) that took place from 26 Oct - 26 Nov 2020.

> The idea behind Argos Delivery is to make use of _IOTA Streams_ to track a delivery throughout the entire delivery process by creating a so-called _"digital twin"_ -- an image of the real-world object on the IOTA ledger. The immutability of the data on the Tangle helps to ensure trust.

Sensors attached to the package send their current state to the Tangle, the Argos backend fetches that data, applies business logic to it and thereby determines the state of the delivery.
In the case of a package drop, the Argos frontend allows to see where and when the drop has happened.

Thus, Argos can help make deliveries safer for the receiver and better traceable for the sender. Also, insurance issues in case of a damage or loss can be settled easier due to more reliable data available.
